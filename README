Box World 3D
============

How to make levels:
-------------------
1) Create a schematic which is not bigger than 16 nodes in each axis.
2) Put the schematic into mods/boxworld/levels/ and name it level<n>.we where
   <n> stands for the ordinary number.
3) Create a file level<n>.lua in mods/boxworld/levels/ and write there:

level.start_pos = {x = <X>, y = <Y>, z = <Z>}
level.boxes = <B>

<X> stands for the x-coordinate of start, <Y> stands for the y-coordinate of
start, <Z> stands for the z-coordinate of start. <B> stands for the total count
of YELLOW boxes in the start position (don't count the red ones). If you aren't
sure, look into other levels.
